give me prompt for agent coding ai to build a creator onboarding component with steps.
1st step that should prompt them with Name, have to choose if they are Content Creator or Social Media Influencer and Niche. use @category-mockdata.json for niche. it should have niche and when they click it their sub category should come and they should be allowed to choose it.
and below they will have two buttons: i) Finish Later ii) Next
if they click finish later, we will bring them into their dashboard.
else 2nd step: UI to link they social media platforms: instagram, facebook, tiktok, youtube. they can either connect one or many.
